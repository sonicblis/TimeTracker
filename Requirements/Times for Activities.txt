The user can choose a group of activities and start timing themselves.  The timer can provide a countdown to starting that the user can set very easily.  Once the timer has started, it should be incredibly easy to switch between activities.  The user can pause the timer and resume it.  Once the user is finished timing all activities, the time can be saved for future reference.  A saved time for a group of activities can also be shared with a simple url that anyone can access.
